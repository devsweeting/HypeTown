## Description

On our site, you give a location and date range to generate a list of performances playing in within those parameters (based off of the Songkick API). Next this site generates a Spotify playlist based off of those artists return from first call. It then displays artists, venues, and event page link.

## Known Bugs

* Not all artists songs are returned
* Artists from spotify are displayed out of order on the page
* Moving too quickly on the page can create an endless loop somehow.
* Making multiple searches without refreshing the page will append to the current lists, rather than start the whole thing over again
* CSS :hover sizing could be a bit smoother
